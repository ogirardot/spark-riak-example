This project is a small subset of features that the [spark-riak-connector](https://github.com/basho/spark-riak-connector) allows.
It demonstrates the following features : 

 * Full Bucket read
 * Query by key on a bucket
 * save back to a bucket
 * case class usage with save and read from and to a bucket

Enjoy !
